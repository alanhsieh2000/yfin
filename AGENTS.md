# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
Keep application code under `src/` and organize related Yahoo Finance logic into focused modules or subpackages. Place tests under `test/`, using one test file per module where practical. Root-level project files include `README.md` for project intent, `requirements.txt` for Python dependencies, `Dockerfile` for the container image, and `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` for the preferred development environment.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
Set up dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Run the test suite with `python -m unittest discover -s test`; this matches the repository's `unittest`-based test expectation. For container-based development, build the image with `docker build -t yfin .`. If you use VS Code Dev Containers, open the repository with the existing `.devcontainer` config instead of recreating the environment manually.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
Target Python 3.12 to stay aligned with the `Dockerfile`. Use 4-space indentation, snake_case for modules, functions, and variables, and PascalCase for classes. Keep files and class names descriptive, for example `src/watchlist/downloader.py` or `HistoricalPriceClient`. Isolate Yahoo Finance request handling from data transformation logic so API changes are easier to contain.

## Testing Guidelines
Write tests with the standard library `unittest` framework. Name test files `test_*.py` and test methods `test_*`. Add coverage for each new parsing, normalization, or fetch workflow, and prefer deterministic fixtures or mocks when network responses are involved. Keep external API calls out of unit tests unless a test is explicitly marked as an integration check.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
This repository does not yet have commit history, so use short imperative commit messages such as `Add ETF quote downloader`. Keep commits focused on one change. Pull requests should explain the behavior change, list the commands run for verification, and include sample output or payload notes when market-data handling changes.

## Security & Configuration Tips
Do not hardcode credentials, cookies, or local watchlist data in tracked files. Treat Yahoo Finance responses as unstable input: validate expected fields, handle missing data defensively, and document any required environment-specific configuration in `README.md`.

# ExecPlans
When writing complex features or significant refactors, use an ExecPlan (as described in PLANS.md) from design to implementation.
